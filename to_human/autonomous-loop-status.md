# Autonomous Loop Status — GameData pipeline

## Round 1 @ 2026-05-19T00:00:00Z
- Picked: Fix `test_auto_release_script.py::TestSemVerPatchBump::test_patch_bump_from_commits` failing because `scripts/auto_release.sh` unconditionally required `gh` CLI even in `DRY_RUN=true` test mode.
- Result: committed b7552831

## Round 2 @ 2026-06-12T03:30:00Z
- Picked: Fix broken `patches/cluster-week1-2026-05-18/D2-zbuffer-exr/test_zbuffer_to_exr.py` import path (was pointing to non-existent `../bin` instead of local module) and rename `zbuffer_to_exr.NEW_DESIGN.py` to `zbuffer_to_exr.py` so tests can import it.
- Result: committed 56704290

## Round 3 @ 2026-06-12T10:53:18Z
- Picked: Fix global pytest collection failure — `tests/test_batch_bundler.py` failed with `ImportError: cannot import name 'build_manifest'` because pytest discovered tests in `patches/cluster-week3-2026-05-18/B1-bundler-broken/`, which added its directory to sys.path, causing the broken `batch_bundler.py` in patches to shadow `bin/batch_bundler.py`.
- Result: committed 90488dee
