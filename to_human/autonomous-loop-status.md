# Autonomous Loop Status — GameData pipeline

## Round 1 @ 2026-05-19T00:00:00Z
- Picked: Fix `test_auto_release_script.py::TestSemVerPatchBump::test_patch_bump_from_commits` failing because `scripts/auto_release.sh` unconditionally required `gh` CLI even in `DRY_RUN=true` test mode.
- Result: committed b7552831

## Round 2 @ 2026-06-12T03:30:00Z
- Picked: Fix broken `patches/cluster-week1-2026-05-18/D2-zbuffer-exr/test_zbuffer_to_exr.py` import path (was pointing to non-existent `../bin` instead of local module) and rename `zbuffer_to_exr.NEW_DESIGN.py` to `zbuffer_to_exr.py` so tests can import it.
- Result: committed 56704290

## Round 3 @ 2026-06-12T10:53:18Z
- Picked: Fix global pytest collection failure — `tests/test_batch_bundler.py` failed with `ImportError: cannot import name 'build_manifest'` because pytest discovered tests in `patches/cluster-week3-2026-05-18/B1-bundler-broken/`, which added its directory to sys.path, causing the broken `batch_bundler.py` in patches to shadow `bin/batch_bundler.py`.
- Result: committed 90488dee

## Round 4 @ 2026-06-12T11:10:00Z
- Picked: Fix failing `tests/test_ci_workflow_validity.py::TestCIWorkflowValidity::test_recorder_ci_file_exists` — test referenced non-existent `recorder-ci.yml` but actual workflow file is `recorder-cargo-check.yml`. Updated fixture path and adjusted assertions to match the real workflow (cargo-check job, cargo check command).
- Result: committed 35f917e7

## Round 5 @ 2026-06-12T11:30:00Z
- Picked: Fix global pytest collection INTERNALERROR — `scripts/upload_to_r2.py` called `sys.exit(1)` at module level when `boto3` was not installed, killing pytest collection for all tests. Replaced with `_MissingBoto3` sentinel that defers the error to call time and supports `mock.patch` attribute access.
- Result: committed 1b624d87

## Round 6 @ 2026-06-12T11:45:00Z
- Picked: Fix failing `tests/test_auto_tag_bot.py::TestCommitThreshold::test_below_threshold_no_tag` — `scripts/auto_tag_bot.sh` unconditionally required `gh` CLI even when `DRY_RUN=true` (test mode). Added `DRY_RUN` guard so the pre-flight check is skipped in test mode, matching the pattern used in `auto_release.sh` (Round 1).
- Result: committed 35216aa6
